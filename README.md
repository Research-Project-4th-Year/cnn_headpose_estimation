In this work, I am going to speed up the existing head-pose estimation(**Hopenet**) method by using **knowledge distillation techniques**. The network is trained and tested by using BIWI dataset. 

The original repository of Hopenet is [GitHub](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose)
For details about the method and quantitative results please check their CVPR Workshop [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00925).
